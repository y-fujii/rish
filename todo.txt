language:
	x array slicing
	- map/dict type?
	- arithmetic expressions
	- builtin commands for strings, such as regex operations
	- pipe/redirection for non-stdin/stdout
	- pipe object
	- multiple pipes support like select(), epoll()
	- lambda expression with lexical scoped break, continue and return?
	- eliminate unnecessary threads creation
	- look up variable names at compile time
	- function local current directory
	- zsh like ** expansion
	- CPS tree evaluation & lightweight thread & asynchronous I/O?
	- In C++11, std::string is not ref-counted. we may wish to use shared_ptr<string>.

UI:
	- job control
	- (att|det)atching process using named pipe for std(in|out|err)
	- incremental completion
	- quicksilver like command name completion
	- sandbox mode
